# Heat-Transfer
A collection of MATLAB projects and homework assignments completed as part of a Heat Transfer course. Each program explores a core concept in thermal analysis — from conduction and convection to fin theory — implemented numerically to reinforce the underlying physical principles.

## 2D Fin Simulation
This program models steady-state heat conduction in a 2D fin using the Finite Difference Method (FDM) and Gauss-Seidel iterations. It solves for the temperature distribution across the fin geometry, computes the heat rate for varying values of delta, and aspect ratios. Results are compared across configurations to illustrate how fin geometry influences thermal performance.
